## Profile

I’m constantly looking for opportunities to learn new things or play new roles. I like to attend Java related conferences and JUG meetups.
My key interest is traveling on motorcycle. I’m also spending a lot of time playing economic and strategic euro style boardgames. Recently I’ve started curses of architectural drawing. When I find some more time I like making things, electronic circuits, programming microcontrollers or even make hands dirty in mechanical workshop.
