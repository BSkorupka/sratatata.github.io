I’m leaving and working at Warsaw, Poland. Currently employed by Samsung R&D as an Big Data developer in AI - Samsung Health Data Analitics team. I’m interested with back-end development and middleware development, however recently also mobile and wearable solutions. Most of my skills are focused around JVM ecosystem. But I like to learn new languages as an inspiration for my code style. I believe in clean code and XP techniques, so I’m trying constantly to improve my workshop and tools assortment.

As other activities which makes me busy at weekends I could list my beloved family and couple of hobbies. I like to travel around Europe on my orange Kawasaki motorcycle. Recently I’ve also built some metal workshop, which makes me very proud and opens a lot of perspectives for making use of my skills to build some CNC machines and models. I’m also interested with electronics and homemade IoT devices. Additionally I like to read good science-fiction and play board-games. Sometimes I draw pencil portraits.
