I've decided to start writing so I could remember better some things. Also I like to introduce my self to those people who are looking for my profile in the internet. 

I hate writing articles and tutorials. My style is rubish and english is poor, so I thought is great base to writing blog. Maight be or maight be not an motivation to gather some loose thoughts about things I like to talk about, but I'm to slow to speak about.

So I keep my thingers crossed to keep this thing running more than 1 month flash in the pan.
